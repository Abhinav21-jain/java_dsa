Question
1. You are required to print the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
2. You are also required to print the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of the same numbers.
3. Take input "num1" and "num2" as the two numbers.
4. Print their GCD and LCM.

b
.. where 'a' and 'b' are the GCD and LCM respectively.
Constraints
2 <= n <= 10^9
Sample Input

      Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
      int num1 = scn.nextInt();
      int num2 = scn.nextInt();
      
      int onum1 = num1;
      int onum2 = num2;
      while (num1 % num2 != 0){
          int rem = num1 % num2;
          num1 = num2;
          num2 = rem;
      }
      int gcd = num2;
      int lcm = (onum1 * onum2) / gcd;
      System.out.println(gcd);
      System.out.println(lcm);
     }
    }
